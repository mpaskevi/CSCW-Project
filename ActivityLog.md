**Meeting Sep. 30th**
*Participants:* Krista, Eli, Michael and Maryi

Established that the purpose of our project is to design and evaluate some application related to CSCW.  We articulated and agreed on a regular weekly meeting at 12:45 on Wednesdays. We then each shared our strengths and interests, some of this is based on recall so feel free to adjust: 

* Dustin - interest in games and writing code
* Eli - Enjoys programming, some experience with C, Python and Java. 
* Krista - Enjoys design and user interfaces
* Maryia - Experience with software development in desktop environments, enjoys design 
* Michael - Interseted in research, data analysis, writing, etc.

Some ideas for the project were discussed: 
* Eli mentioned a Twitch based collaborative gaming project idea - perhaps scope out more for next weeks meeting.
* Google Doc to be used to collect further ideas in advance of next meeting. 

*TO-DOs before next meeting:*

1. Each of us will think about at least one project idea and will write the description on: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ENG_ZSm2JEAU97AQBaiBCiRj5kWCX1d_n82cIbRruzQ/edit (when you are crafting your idea, try to frame it within a specific research question) 

2. Create GitHub accounts (if you don't have one already), submit the username to Maryi -to be added to the repository, and play around with the tool.

*Next meeting:* Oct. 7th 12:45 place?  
  * I suggest we consdier a new place, but I do not know the buildings around CS well.
